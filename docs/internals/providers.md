# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. T3 Code supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with eight entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `atomic`      | [`Drivers/AtomicDriver.ts`][atomic]     |
| `pi`          | [`Drivers/PiDriver.ts`][pi]             |
| `omp`         | [`Drivers/OmpDriver.ts`][omp]           |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]       |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]     |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]     |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]         |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode] |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

Adding a built-in driver also requires its settings schema and default-instance hydration plus its
client presentation metadata. The orchestration model remains provider-agnostic; change its
contracts only when the provider introduces a capability that must cross the wire.

Pi and Atomic share a Pi-RPC lifecycle adapter, while Atomic adds workflow lifecycle projection and
workflow source inspection. See [Pi and Atomic providers](./providers-pi-atomic.md) for the protocol
contract, event mappings, extension UI behavior, and known boundaries.

Oh My Pi shares that transport seam but negotiates RPC v2 and adds phased todos, lossless chunking,
child-agent lifecycle/transcripts, explicit follow-up controls, and terminal settlement rules. See
[Oh My Pi provider](./providers-omp.md) for the 20-group harness parity matrix and acceptance gates.

When the environment enables T3-owned browser or Computer Use access, Codex receives the shared
toolkit through T3's local MCP server. Pi, Atomic, and Oh My Pi receive the same toolkit through a private
bundled extension that proxies their tool and approval traffic to that MCP server. The
[T3 Computer Use specification](./computer-use.md) owns the host, policy, lifecycle, authorization,
and remaining release-gate contract.

Codex can optionally bridge to OpenAI's signed macOS Computer Use MCP client from its shared
`CODEX_HOME`. The OpenAI helper, not T3 Code, owns the host's Accessibility and Screen Recording
permissions.
See [Codex Computer Use](./providers-codex-computer-use.md) for discovery, session configuration,
approval routing, remote semantics, and current bridge boundaries.

## Model manifest

The model picker's legacy section is driven by `apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json`, which
lists the current (non-legacy) model slugs per driver kind. The `ModelManifest` service
(`apps/server/src/provider/ModelManifest.ts`) refreshes that data from the same file on `main` via
raw.githubusercontent.com, so moving a model in or out of the legacy section is a commit, not a
release. Preference order is remote fetch, then the on-disk copy of the last successful fetch (in
the state directory), then the bundled copy. Fetches are TTL-gated, run concurrently with provider
probes, respect the `enableProviderUpdateChecks` setting, and never fail a provider check. The
Codex and Claude drivers apply the classification to every snapshot with `applyModelManifest`;
driver kinds absent from the manifest have no legacy concept.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.
